## 🌟 Overview

🔐 **Simple Power Analysis (SPA)** is a fundamental approach in side-channel analysis of cryptosystems, but it often demands intensive manual effort for **trace segmentation**.  

✨ The original **SPA-GPT** framework (CHES 2024) introduced reinforcement learning to automate segmentation, but its **low efficiency** and focus on **public-key algorithms** restricted its broader application.  

🚀 In this project, we propose a **practical and efficient enhancement** to SPA-GPT — integrating **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and an **attention mechanism**, together with a **Simulated Annealing-based Deep Q-Network policy**.   
💡 Experiments show a **50.34%–94.24% boost in time efficiency** and an **80% reduction in model parameters** compared to the original SPA-GPT.
